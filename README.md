==========================

This repository contains the codes used to generate the version-1 of DustCOMM dataset (Adebiyi et al. Geoscientific Model Development), which are annual and seasonal climatologies of constrained dust aerosol properties, including spatially-varying dust size distribution, mass extinction efficiency, and atmospheric dust loading.
This code uses modeling constraints from six global models, namely GISS, WRFChem, CESM, GEOSChem, CNRM (ARPEGE), IMPACT.

The consolidated DustCOMM (v1) output data can be downloaded on Zenodo using this link http://zenodo.org/record/2620475

In addition to this ReadMe file, three other files (dustcomm_main.m, define_global_variables.m, and run_dustcomm) and three folders (model_data, functions, use_script) are provided in this repository.
Below, we give a brief description of each file/folder.

--------
The three (3) files
--------
1.  dustcomm_main.m           -- This is the main MATLAB file that produce DustCOMM's annually-averaged and seasonally-averaged estimates.
2.  define_global_variables.m -- Global parameters and variables are defined here. You can also define the  directories for both input and output datasets.
3.  run_dustcomm              -- simple Unix code to run "dustcomm_main.m" in the background and parse the standard output & error into a file "matlabjob.txt". This is perhaps better not suitable for a desktop computer.

--------
The three (3) Folders
--------
1.  functions   -- This folder contains main functions used in DustCOMM
2.  use_script  -- This folder contains auxiliary functions used in DustCOMM
3.  input_data  -- This folder contains the input data into dustCOMM.
